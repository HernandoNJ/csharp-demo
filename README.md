## ðŸ’¡ Future Learning & Planned Topics

The following topics are planned for future implementation and study within this repository:

  * **Collections:** In-depth exploration of various collections and their performance characteristics.
  * **Projects, Assemblies, and Solutions:** Detailed understanding of project structure, assembly management, and solution organization.
  * **Numeric Types:** Practical examples and nuances of different numeric data types in C\#.
  * **Events:** Implementing and working with events and delegates.
  * **Unit Testing:** Integrating and implementing robust unit tests for project code.
  * **Clean Code:** Focused refactoring and application of "Clean Code" principles.
  * **Multithreading and Asynchrony:** Exploring `async`/`await`, `Task` management, and parallel programming.

## ðŸ’» Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/HernandoNJ/dotnet-practice
    ```
2.  **Open the solution file** (`.sln`) in Visual Studio or your preferred IDE.
3.  Add one or more existing projects to the solution from its folder. <br>
Note: After commit `61ceeca`, project files (.csproj) were re-added following a Git cleanup and restructuring to build a new dev portfolio combining multiple repositories.
4. **Run** each project's `Program.cs` file to preview its execution.
5. Explore the project folders to find code examples relevant to each topic.
